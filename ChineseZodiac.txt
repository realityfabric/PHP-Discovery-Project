The "Chinese Zodiac" is similar to the Zodiac associated with western astrology. The Chinese Zodiac assigns an animal to each of 12 one-year long periods. At the end of the 12 years the zodiac repeats itself.

The animals are as follows: Rat, Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, and Pig.

The Chinese Zodiac is similar in its complexity to the Western Zodiac. Where the Western Zodiac has Sun and Moon signs (among a number of others), the Chinese Zodiac has Inner, True, and Secret signs.
